Okaaaay. A new project. Feeling a bit lost, as usual. 

Anyway, the goal of this project is to understand things like npm and webpack better and to learn how to structure project files, because before it've been a huge mess. Ok, also probably should use ES6 modules?? 

TO-DO:
- you've got to figure out how to set up sass and not make a mess. do I need to use css-loader? tbh I'm not sure why I should import css files from within JS modules
