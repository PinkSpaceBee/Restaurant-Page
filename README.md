## Responsive restaurant page built with ES6 modules.

I started this project to learn how to work with ES6 features like classes and modules, and with module bundlers, namely webpack. That is to say, I could've come up with a better idea for a project if I wanted to do something inheritance-related, but still, it was fun.
