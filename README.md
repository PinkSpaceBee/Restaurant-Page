Responsive restaurant page built with ES6 modules. 

I started this project to learn how to work with ES6 features like classes and modules, and module bundlerm, namely webpack. That is to say I could've come up with a better idea for a project if I wanted to do something inheritance-related but still, it was fun. 

Take a look!

Built with: 

JavaScript ES6+
